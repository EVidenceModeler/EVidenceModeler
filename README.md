Run 'make' to build the required ParaFly cmd parallel execution utility.

(If plugins/ParaFly is missing, first run:
   git submodule init && git submodule update
to incorporate the included ParaFly submodule)


## Additional example sample data sets

While a small test example is included under testing/, you can download a larger set of test data by running 'make large_sample_data'.  This will download data into a directory EVM_sample_data/, in which you'll find data sets with included runMe.sh scripts for EVM execution.
