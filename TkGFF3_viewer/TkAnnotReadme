TkAnnotationViewer requires the following perl modules to be installed:

Tk
XML::Parser
XML::Simple
Data::Dumper


These can be obtained from CPAN via:

>perl -MCPAN -e shell
>install XML::Parser

Alternatively, if you have perl installed from http://www.activestate.com
you can use the ppm tool:

>ppm
>install XML-Simple


After installing the perl modules, you should be able to run the 
-ultra-light-weight- Annotation viewer by typing
>perl TkAnnotationviewer.pl


Open up one of your TIGR-XML formatted annotation files to view the gene annotations and sequences.
